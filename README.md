Introduction :
pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly.
This README provides an overview of some of the fundamental features and functionalities of pandas.

Series :
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating-point numbers, Python objects, etc.). 
The labels (also known as the index) need not be unique but must be hashable.

DataFrame :
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be seen as a dictionary of Series objects.

Indexing and Selecting Data

iloc :
iloc is primarily integer-based indexing for selection by position.

loc :
loc is label-based indexing for selection by label.

Sorting Data :
Sorting is a crucial step in data analysis for better readability and preparation.

Handling Duplicates :
Removing duplicates is essential to ensure data integrity. 

Handling Missing Data : 
Handling missing data is vital for maintaining data quality.

Data Filtering :
Filtering data helps in extracting specific information based on criteria.

Conditional Changes : 
Conditional changes allow updating the DataFrame based on a condition.
